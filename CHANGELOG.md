- Edge cases covered: overnight shifts, month boundaries, invalid inputs
- Accessibility testing for keyboard navigation and screen readers
- Cross-browser compatibility maintained

### Performance
- Minimal bundle size impact with tree-shakable utility functions
- Efficient date calculations using native Date API
