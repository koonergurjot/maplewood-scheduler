# Offering Workflow

Vacancies progress through a sequence of offering tiers. Each tier represents a
pool of employees eligible to cover the vacancy.

1. **Casuals** – default tier when a vacancy is created.
2. **OT – Full-Time**
3. **OT – Casuals**
4. **Last Resort – RN** – requires confirmation before activation.

When a vacancy is created, the offering round starts immediately and lasts 120
minutes by default. A countdown timer tracks the remaining time. When the timer
expires and auto‑advance is enabled, the system automatically moves to the next
tier and logs the change to the audit log. Managers can adjust the round length,
turn auto‑advance on or off, or manually change tiers at any time. Manual
changes also log to the audit trail and optionally capture a free‑text note.
